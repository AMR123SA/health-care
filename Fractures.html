                ​<p class="main-subtitle">​Immediate Care and First Aid Steps</p>
                <h2 class="header-text">Overview</h2>
                 ​<p class="subtitle-text">A fracture occurs when a bone is subjected to pressure or force that exceeds its capacity, causing it to crack or break. Fractures range from minor stress cracks to compound fractures where the bone protrudes through the skin. Because fractures can cause permanent damage or injury to nerves and blood vessels, first aid must be administered promptly.

                 </p>
 <h2 class="header-text2">​When to Seek Emergency Care</h2>
   <p class="subtitle-text">​Call 911 (or your local emergency number) immediately if:</p>
   <ul class="list">
<li>​There is heavy bleeding that does not stop.</li>
<li>​The bone is protruding through the skin (open fracture).</li>
<li>​The injured limb is visibly deformed or at an unnatural angle.</li>
<li>​The person feels numbness, coldness, or the skin turns blue/gray below the injury.</li>
<li>​The fracture is in a critical area like the skull, neck, back, or pelvis.</li>
<li>​The person loses consciousness or shows signs of shock (paleness, rapid breathing, dizziness).</li>
   </ul>
<h2 class="header-title">Treatment</h2>
<p class="subtitle-text">​If you are assisting someone with a suspected fracture, follow these steps:

</p>
<h3 class="secound-title">​1. Immobilize the Area</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>​Do not attempt to realign the bone or push it back in.</li>
<li>​Use a temporary splint (using wood, folded magazines, or cardboard) to stabilize the joints above and below the fracture site.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="secound-title">​2. Control Bleeding</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>​If there is a wound, apply gentle pressure with a clean, sterile cloth to stop bleeding. </li>
<li>Avoid pressing directly on the broken bone.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="secound-title">​3. Reduce Swelling (Ice Packs)</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>​Apply ice packs wrapped in a cloth to the injured area for 15–20 minutes. Do not apply ice directly to the skin.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="secound-title">​4. Elevate the Injury</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>​If possible, raise the fractured limb above the level of the heart to reduce swelling and pain.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="secound-title">​5. Prevent Shock</h3>
<ul class="list">
    <li>​Have the person lie down comfortably, cover them with a blanket to keep them warm, and reassure them until medical help arrives.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="header-title">​Special Cases</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><span>​Spinal Injuries:</span>Never move the person unless they are in immediate danger (e.g., a fire). Keep the head and neck completely still.</li>
<li><span>​Rib Fractures: </span> Help the person remain in a comfortable position (usually sitting up) to make breathing easier.</li>

</ul>
<h2 class="header-title">​What to Avoid (Precautions) </h2>
<ul class="list">
<li>❌ Do not move the person: Unless it is absolutely necessary for their safety.</li>
<li>​❌ Do not try to "reset" the bone: Attempting to straighten the bone can rupture ligaments or blood vessels.</li>
<li>​❌ Do not give the person food or water: They may require emergency surgery and anesthesia, which requires an empty stomach.

</li>
<li>​❌ Do not test the range of motion: Do not ask the person to move the limb to "check" if it is broken.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="header-title">​Prevention Tips</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><span>​Strengthen Bones:​</span>Ensure a diet rich in Calcium and Vitamin D.</li>
<li><span>Physical Activity:​</span>Engage in weight-bearing exercises to increase bone density.</li>
<li><span>​Home Safety:​</span> Remove "trip hazards" like loose rugs and ensure hallways are well-lit (especially for the elderly).</li>
<li><span>​Protective Gear:​</span>Wear helmets and joint guards during contact sports or cycling.</li>
</ul>
<span>⚠️ Note: Even if a fracture seems minor, an X-ray is essential to confirm the type of break and ensure it heals correctly without future deformity.</span>
