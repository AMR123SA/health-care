         <p class="main-subtitle">​Immediate Care and First Aid Steps</p>
            <h2 class="header-text">Overview</h2>
        ​<p class="subtitle-text">​Choking occurs when a foreign object—usually food in adults or small toy parts in children—becomes lodged in the throat or windpipe, blocking the flow of air. Because choking cuts off oxygen to the brain, first aid must be administered as quickly as possible. It is a leading cause of accidental death, particularly among young children and the elderly.

        </p>
       <h2 class="header-text2">​When to Seek Emergency Care</h2>
          <p class="subtitle-text">​Call 911 (or your local emergency number) immediately if:</p>

       <ul class="list">
<li>​The person cannot breathe, cough, or speak at all.</li>
<li>​The person’s skin, lips, or nails start to turn blue or gray.</li>
<li>​The person becomes unconscious or faints.</li>
<li>​You are alone and unable to dislodge the object yourself.</li>
<li>The person continues to have a persistent cough or difficulty swallowing after the object is removed.</li>
<span>⚠️ Note: Even if the object is successfully cleared, it is recommended to see a doctor to ensure no damage was done to the throat or airway.</span>
       </ul>
<h2 class="header-title">Treatment</h2>
<p class="subtitle-text">​The recommended technique for a conscious person is the "Five-and-Five" approach:</p>
<h3 class="secound-title">​1. Five Back Blows</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>​Stand to the side and just behind the choking person.</li>
<li>​Place one arm across their chest for support and lean them forward.</li>
<li>​Deliver five separate back blows between the person's shoulder blades with the heel of your hand.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="secound-title">​2. Five Abdominal Thrusts (Heimlich Maneuver)</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>​Stand behind the person and wrap your arms around their waist.</li>
<li>​Make a fist and place it just above the person's navel (belly button).</li>
<li>​Grasp your fist with your other hand.</li>
<li>​Perform five quick, inward and upward thrusts as if trying to lift the person.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="secound-title">​3. Repeat</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>​Alternate between 5 blows and 5 thrusts until the blockage is dislodged or the person becomes unconscious.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="header-title">​Special Cases</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><span>​For Infants (Under 1 year): </span> Place the infant face down on your forearm, resting on your thigh. Give 5 gentle back slaps, then flip them over and give 5 chest thrusts with two fingers.</li>
<li><span>​For Pregnant or Obese People:</span>Place your hands higher up, at the base of the breastbone (the chest), rather than the abdomen.</li>
<li><span>​If the person faints:</span>Lower them to the floor, call for help, and begin CPR (chest compressions).</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="header-title">​What to Avoid (Precautions)</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li>​❌ Do not interfere if the person is coughing forcefully—let them try to cough the object out.</li>
<li>​❌ Do not perform a "blind finger sweep" (sticking your finger in the throat) unless you can clearly see and grab the object, as you might push it deeper.</li>
<li>​❌ Do not give the person water or food while they are choking.
​</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="header-title">​Prevention Tips</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><span>​Cut food small:</span> Especially high-risk items like grapes, hot dogs, and hard candies.</li>
<li><span>​Chew thoroughly: </span> Avoid talking, laughing, or running while eating.</li>
<li><span>​Child-proofing:</span>Keep small objects (coins, balloons, small batteries) out of reach of toddlers.</li>
</ul>
