<p class="main-subtitle">    Immediate Care and First Aid Steps  </p>
<h2 class="header-text">Overview</h2>
​<p class="subtitle-text">Burns are tissue damage resulting from various causes, including exposure to hot liquids, sunlight, flames, chemicals, electricity, and steam. Kitchen-related injuries are common among children, often caused by hot beverages, soup, and microwave-heated foods.
​Major burns require emergency medical assistance, while minor burns can usually be treated with first aid.
</p>
<h2 class="header-text2">When to Seek Emergency Care</h2>
<p class="subtitle-text">  call 911 (or your local emergency number) immediately for severe burns that:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>​Are deep, affecting all layers of the skin.</li>
​<li>Cause the skin to look dry and leathery.</li>
<li>​Appear charred or have white, brown, or black patches.</li>
<li>​Are larger than 3 inches (about 8 centimeters) in diameter.</li>
<li>​Cover the hands, feet, face, groin, buttocks, a major joint, or encircle an arm or leg.</li>
<li>Are accompanied by smoke inhalation.</li>
<li>​Begin to swell rapidly.</li>
</ul>
<span>​Note:</span> Electrical burns (including lightning) and major chemical burns require emergency care. A minor burn may also need emergency attention if it affects the eyes, mouth, hands, or genitals. Infants and older adults may require emergency care even for minor burns
<h2 class="header-title">Treatment</h2>
<h3 class="secound-title">Major Burns</h3>
<p class="subtitle-text">While waiting for emergency medical teams, provide the following first aid:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><span>​Protect the victim:</span> Ensure the person is no longer in contact with the burn source, provided it is safe for you to help. For electrical burns, disconnect the power source first.</li>
<li><span>​Check breathing:</span> Verify the person is breathing; if necessary, begin rescue breathing if you are trained.</li>
<li><span>​Remove constrictions:</span> Take off jewelry, belts, and tight clothing, especially around the burned area and neck, as swelling occurs rapidly.</li>
<li><span>​Cover the burn:</span> Use a sterile gauze or a clean cloth; keep the dressing loose.</li>
<li><span>​Elevate the area:</span> Raise the burned site above heart level if possible.</li>
<li><span>​Monitor for shock:</span> Watch for symptoms like cool/clammy skin, a weak pulse, and shallow breathing.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="secound-title">​Minor Burns</h3>
<p class="subtitle-text">​For minor burns, follow these steps:</p>
<ul class="list">
    <li><span>​Cool the burn:</span>  Hold the area under cool (not cold) running water for about 10 minutes. If this isn't possible, apply a cool, damp cloth. For mouth burns from food/drink, hold an ice cube in the mouth for a few minutes</li>
    <li><span>​Remove tight items:</span> Gently remove rings or tight objects before the area swells.</li>
    <li><span> Apply lotion:</span> Once cooled, apply a lotion such as Aloe Vera or cocoa butter to prevent dryness.</li>
    <li><span>​Bandage the burn:</span> Cover with a clean bandage. Wrap it loosely to avoid pressure. This protects blisters and reduces pain by blocking air contact.</li>
    <li><span>​Pain relief:</span> If needed, use over-the-counter relievers like Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB) or Acetaminophen (Tylenol).</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="header-title">What to Avoid (Precautions)</h2>
<ul class="list">
    <li>​Do not use ice or very cold water to cool the burn.</li>
    <li>​Do not break blisters, as they protect against infection. If a blister breaks, clean it gently with water and apply an antibiotic ointment.</li>
    <li>​Do not attempt to remove clothing that is stuck to the burned skin.</li>

</ul>
<h2 class="header-title">When to Contact a Doctor</h2>
  <p class="subtitle-text">If your last Tetanus shot was more than five years ago and the burn is deep, your doctor may recommend a booster dose. This should ideally be administered within 48 hours of the injury.</p>
