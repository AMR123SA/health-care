        <h2 class="header-text">Overview</h2>
        ​<p class="subtitle-text">Cardiac arrest is a sudden loss of heart function, breathing, and consciousness. It usually results from an electrical disturbance in the heart that disrupts its pumping action, stopping blood flow to the body. Unlike a heart attack (which is caused by blocked blood flow), cardiac arrest is primarily an electrical problem. Without immediate treatment, cardiac arrest can be fatal within minutes.
        </p>
        <h2 class="header-text2">When to Seek Emergency Care </h2>
        <p class="subtitle-text">Call 911 (or your local emergency number) immediately if someone:
        </p>
        <ul class="list">
<li>Suddenly collapses and becomes unresponsive.</li>
<li>Has no pulse or heartbeat.</li>
<li>Stops breathing or only gasps irregularly.</li>
<li>Loses consciousness without warning</li>
        </ul>

    <h2 class="header-title">Treatment</h2>
    <h3 class="secound-title">Major Cardiac Arrest (Emergency Response) </h3>
    <p class="subtitle-text">While waiting for emergency medical teams, provide the following first aid:</p>
    <ul class="list">
<li><span>Check responsiveness:</span>Tap the person and shout to see if they respond.</li>
<li><span>Call for help: </span>Dial emergency services and, if available, ask someone to bring an AED (Automated External Defibrillator).</li>
<li><span>Check breathing and pulse:</span>If absent, begin CPR immediately.
</li>
<li><span>Start CPR: </span>Push hard and fast in the center of the chest (about 2 inches deep, 100–120 compressions per minute).</li>
<li><span>Use AED:</span>As soon as it arrives, turn it on, follow the voice prompts, and deliver a shock if advised.</li>
<li><span>Continue CPR:</span> Alternate chest compressions and rescue breaths (if trained), until medical help arrives or the person shows signs of life.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="secound-title">Minor Cardiac Events (Warning Signs)</h3>
<p class="subtitle-text">Not all heart problems lead directly to cardiac arrest. Seek medical evaluation if someone experiences</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Chest pain or pressure.</li>
<li>Shortness of breath.</li>
<li>Dizziness or fainting spells.</li>
<li>Palpitations or irregular heartbeat.</li>
<li>Unexplained fatigue.</li>
    </ul>
    <span>Early detection and treatment of these symptoms can prevent cardiac arrest.</span>
    <h2 class="header-title">What to Avoid (Precautions)</h2>
    <ul class="list"></ul>
    <li>❌ Do not delay calling emergency services.</li>
    <li>❌ Do not stop CPR unless the person regains consciousness or professional help takes over.</li>
    <li>❌ Do not ignore warning signs like fainting or chest pain.</li>
</ul>
    <h2 class="header-title">When to Contact a Doctor</h2>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>If you have a family history of sudden cardiac arrest or heart disease.</li>
        <li>If you experience unexplained fainting, chest pain, or irregular heartbeat.</li>
        <li>After recovery from cardiac arrest, ongoing medical care and lifestyle changes are essential to prevent recurrence.</li>
