                 <h2 class="header-text">Overview</h2>
​<p class="subtitle-text">​A seizure is a sudden, uncontrolled electrical disturbance in the brain. It can cause changes in behavior, movements, or feelings, and in levels of consciousness. While some seizures look like dramatic shaking (convulsions), others may simply involve a person staring blankly into space or appearing confused.</p>
<h2 class="header-text2">​When to Seek Emergency Care</h2>
<p class="subtitle-text">​Call 911 (or your local emergency number) immediately if:</p>
      <ul class="list">
    <li>​The seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>​The person has a second seizure shortly after the first.</li>
    <li>​The person does not wake up or return to normal after the shaking stops.</li>
    <li>​The person is pregnant, has diabetes, or a heart condition.</li>
    <li>​The seizure happened in water (risk of drowning).</li>
    <li>​This is the person's first-ever seizure.</li>
    <li>​The person is injured during the seizure.</li>
      </ul>
        <h2 class="header-title">​Treatment (The "STAY, SAFE, SIDE" Rule)</h2>
<p class="subtitle-text">​If you are assisting someone having a seizure, follow these steps:</p>
      
<h3 class="secound-title">​1. Stay with the Person</h3>
<ul class="list">
    <li>Remain calm and stay with them until the seizure ends and they are fully awake</li>
<li>​Once it's over, talk to them calmly and help them sit in a safe place.</li>
      </ul>

<h3 class="secound-title">​2. Keep Them Safe</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>Move away hard or sharp objects (like furniture or glasses).</li>
<li>​Place something soft and flat (like a folded jacket) under their head to prevent injury.</li>
<li>​Loosen any tight clothing around their neck (like a tie or collar).</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="secound-title">​3. Turn Them on Their Side</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>​As soon as the person stops shaking and is relaxed, turn them onto their side (Recovery Position). This helps keep the airway clear and prevents choking on saliva or vomit.</li>
</ul>
        <h2 class="header-title">What to Avoid (Precautions) </h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><span>​❌ Do not put anything in the person's mouth: </span>It is a myth that people can swallow their tongues. Putting objects in their mouth can break their teeth or cause them to bite you.</li>
<li><span>​❌ Do not restrain the person: </span>Do not try to hold them down or stop their movements; this can cause bone or muscular injuries.</li>
<li><span>​❌ Do not give food or water:</span>Until they are fully alert and aware of their surroundings.</li>
<li><span>​❌ Do not perform CPR:</span> Unless the person does not start breathing again after the seizure has stopped.</li>
</ul>
     <h2 class="header-title">​After the Seizure</h2>
     <ul class="list">
        <li>​The person may be confused, tired, or have a headache.</li>
                <li>​Check if they are wearing a medical alert bracelet or necklace.</li>
                        <li>​Help them remember what happened, as they may have "lost time."</li>
                                <li>​Offer to call a friend, family member, or a taxi to make sure they get home safely.</li>
                                </ul>
                 <h2 class="header-title">​​Common Triggers (To Share with a Doctor)</h2>
                 <p class="subtitle-text">If you can, try to note if the person experienced any of the following before the seizure:</p>
                 <ul class="list">
                <li>​Missed medication (most common cause).</li>
                <li>​Lack of sleep or extreme fatigue.</li>
                <li>​Flashing lights or patterns (photosensitivity).</li>
<li>​High fever or illness.</li>
                 </ul>          
                 <span>​⚠️ Note: Timing the seizure is one of the most helpful things a bystander can do. Note the exact time it starts and ends to tell the paramedics.
