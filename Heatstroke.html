<p class="main-subtitle">Immediate Care and First Aid Steps</p>

<h2 class="header-text">Overview</h2>
<p class="subtitle-text">
Heatstroke is the most severe heat-related illness. It occurs when the body’s temperature regulation fails, causing the core temperature to rise above 40°C (104°F). Without prompt treatment, heatstroke can lead to organ failure, brain damage, or death.
</p>

<h2 class="header-text2">When to Seek Emergency Care</h2>
<p class="subtitle-text">Call 911 (or your local emergency number) immediately if the person shows:</p>
<ul class="list">

<li>Confusion, agitation, or disorientation.</li>
<li>Seizures or loss of consciousness.</li>
<li>Rapid, strong pulse and shallow breathing.</li>
<li>High body temperature (above 40°C / 104°F).</li>
<li>Headache, dizziness, or nausea.</li>
</ul>
