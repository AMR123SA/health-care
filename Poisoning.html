                ​<p class="main-subtitle">​Immediate Care and First Aid Steps</p>
                <h2 class="header-text">Overview</h2>
​<p class="subtitle-text">​Poisoning occurs when a harmful substance enters the body through swallowing, inhalation, skin contact, or injection. Poisons can include drug overdoses, household cleaners, gases (like carbon monoxide), and chemicals. The severity of the situation depends on the type of substance, the amount, and how it entered the body.</p>
 <h2 class="header-text2">​When to Seek Emergency Care</h2>
   <p class="subtitle-text">​Call 911 (or your local emergency/poison control number) immediately if the person:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>​Is unconscious or very drowsy and difficult to wake up.</li>
<li>Has difficulty breathing or has stopped breathing.</li>
<li>​Is experiencing seizures or convulsions.</li>
<li>​Feels severe chest pain or a very rapid heartbeat.</li>
<li>​Shows aggressive behavior or sudden mental confusion.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="header-title">​First Aid Treatment (By Type of Exposure)</h2>
<p class="subtitle-text">​If you are assisting someone with suspected poisoning, follow these steps carefully:</p>
<h3 class="secound-title">​1. Swallowed Poisons (Ingestion)</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>​Remove any remaining traces of the substance from the person's mouth.</li>
<li>​If the substance is a household cleaner or chemical, do not make the person vomit </li>
<li>unless instructed by a professional.</li>
<li>​Keep the container/packaging of the substance to show the medical team.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="secound-title">​2. Inhaled Poisons (Gases)</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>​Immediately move the person to an area with fresh air.</li>
<li>​Open windows and doors if it is safe to do so.</li>

</ul>
<h3 class="secound-title">​3. Poison on Skin or Eyes</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><span>​For Skin: </span>Remove contaminated clothing and rinse the skin with running water for 15–20 minutes.</li>
<li><span>​For Eyes: </span>Gently flush the eye with lukewarm water for at least 20 minutes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="secound-title">​4. Prevent Complications</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>​If the person is vomiting, place them on their side (Recovery Position) to ensure their airway remains clear.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="header-title">​Special Cases</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><span>​Carbon Monoxide:</span>This gas is odorless and colorless. If multiple people in an enclosed space feel a sudden headache, evacuate immediately and call emergency services.</li>
<li><span>​Bites/Stings:</span> Keep the affected limb still and at or below heart level. Do not attempt to "suck out" the venom.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="header-title">​What to Avoid (Precautions)</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li>❌ Do not induce vomiting: Especially if the substance is corrosive (like bleach), as it can burn the esophagus again on its way up.</li>
<li>​❌ Do not give the person food or drink: (such as milk or vinegar) unless directed by poison control; it may react with the poison and worsen the injury.</li>
<li>​❌ Do not wait for symptoms to appear: Some poisons have a delayed effect. Early intervention is lifesaving.</li>
<li>❌ Do not try to "neutralize" the poison: (e.g., giving lemon juice for an alkaline poison). The chemical reaction creates heat that can burn internal tissues.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="header-title">​Prevention Tips</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><span>​Safe Storage:</span>Keep cleaners and medications in locked, high cabinets out of children's reach.</li>
<li><span>​Original Labels: </span>Never transfer chemicals (like detergents or thinners) into water or juice bottles.</li>
<li><span>​Gas Detectors:</span>Install carbon monoxide detectors in homes using gas for heating or cooking.</li>
<li><span>​Safe Disposal: </span>
​Regularly dispose of expired medications.</li>
</ul>
<span>​⚠️ Note: Always keep the number for Poison Control saved in your phone. The information you provide (substance type, time of exposure, age of the victim) is vital for the medical team.</span>
