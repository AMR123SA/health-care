        <h2 class="header-text">Overview</h2>
        ​<p class="subtitle-text">Bleeding is the loss of blood from the circulatory system, usually caused by injury to blood vessels. It can range from minor cuts and scrapes to severe, life-threatening hemorrhage. While small wounds often stop bleeding on their own or with simple first aid, major bleeding requires immediate medical attention to prevent shock or death

        <h2 class="header-text2">When to Seek Emergency Care</h2>
        <p class="subtitle-text">When to Seek Emergency Care
Call 911 (or your local emergency number) immediately if bleeding:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Is severe and does not stop after 10 minutes of firm pressure.</li>
<li>Spurts or gushes from the wound (suggesting arterial bleeding).</li>
<li>Is accompanied by signs of shock (pale skin, rapid breathing, weak pulse).</li>
<li>Occurs after a major accident, fall, or trauma.</li>
<li>Involves deep wounds, especially to the chest, abdomen, or head.</li>
<li>Is internal (vomiting blood, coughing blood, blood in urine/stool).</li>
</ul>
<span>⚠️ Note: Bleeding in infants, elderly, or people with clotting disorders (like hemophilia) requires urgent care even if it seems minor.</span>
<h2 class="header-title">Treatment</h2>
<h3 class="secound-title">Major Bleeding (Emergency Response)</h3>
<p class="subtitle-text">While waiting for emergency medical teams, provide the following first aid:
</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><span>Apply pressure:</span> Use a clean cloth or sterile gauze to press firmly on the wound.</li>
<li><span>Do not remove soaked cloths:</span>Place additional layers on top instead.</li>
<li><span>Elevate the wound: </span> If possible, raise the injured area above heart level.</li>
<li><span>Use a tourniquet (last resort):</span> Only if bleeding is uncontrollable and professional help is delayed.</li>
<li><span>Monitor breathing and consciousness:</span>Be ready to perform CPR if necessary.</li>
<li><span>Prevent shock:</span> Lay the person down, keep them warm, and reassure them.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="secound-title">Minor Bleeding (Cuts and Scrapes)</h3>
<p class="subtitle-text">For minor bleeding, follow these steps:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li><span>Clean the wound: </span>Rinse gently with clean water to remove dirt.</li>
<li><span>Apply pressure:</span> Use a clean cloth until bleeding stops.</li>
<li><span>Disinfect: </span>Apply antiseptic solution or ointment to prevent infection.</li>
<li><span>Bandage: </span>Cover with a sterile bandage or plaster.</li>
<li><span>Pain relief:</span>Use over-the-counter relievers if needed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="header-title">What to Avoid (Precautions)</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li>❌ Do not wash severe wounds with strong pressure (may worsen bleeding).</li>
<li>❌ Do not remove large or deeply embedded objects—leave them for professionals.
</li>
<li>❌ Do not apply a tourniquet unless absolutely necessary.</li>
<li>❌ Do not ignore persistent or unexplained bleeding.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="header-title">When to Contact a Doctor</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li>If bleeding continues despite first aid.</li>
<li>If the wound shows signs of infection (redness, swelling, pus).</li>
<li>If you haven’t had a tetanus shot in the last 5 years and the wound is deep.</li>
<li>If you have a medical condition affecting blood clotting.</li>
</ul>
