<h1 class="main-title"> Tongue Obstruction</h1>
                ​<p class="main-subtitle">​Immediate Care and First Aid Steps</p>
                 <h2 class="header-text">Overview</h2>
              ​<p class="subtitle-text">​​Tongue obstruction is the most common cause of airway blockage in an unconscious person. When a person loses consciousness, the muscles in the jaw relax, causing the tongue to fall backward and block the back of the throat (pharynx). This is often referred to as "swallowing your tongue," although it is anatomically impossible to actually swallow it.

              </p>
<h2 class="header-text2">​Signs of Obstruction</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><span>​Noisy breathing:</span>A snoring or "gurgling" sound in an unconscious person.</li>
<li><span>​Chest movement without air:</span> The chest may rise and fall, but no air is coming out of the mouth or nose.</li>
<li><span>​Cyanosis: </span>The skin, lips, or fingernails may start to turn blue or gray.</li>

</ul>
 <h2 class="header-title">​Treatment: The "Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift" Maneuver</h2>
​<p class="main-subtitle">​If an unconscious person is struggling to breathe or making snoring sounds, follow these steps immediately:</p>
<h3 class="secound-title">​1. Open the Airway</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>​Place one hand on the person’s forehead and apply gentle backward pressure.</li>
<li>​Place the fingertips of your other hand under the bony part of the lower jaw (chin).</li>
<li>​Lift the chin upward. This pulls the tongue forward and away from the back of the throat, opening the airway.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="secound-title">​2. Check for Breathing</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>​Put your ear close to the person's mouth.</li>
<li>​Look for chest rise, Listen for breath sounds, and Feel for air on your cheek for no more than 10 seconds.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="secound-title">​3. Use the Recovery Position</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>​If the person is breathing but remains unconscious, turn them onto their side.</li>
<li>​This uses gravity to keep the tongue from falling back and allows fluids (like saliva) to drain out of the mouth.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="header-title">​Special Case: Suspected Spinal Injury</h2>
              ​<p class="subtitle-text">​If you suspect the person has a neck or spinal injury (e.g., from a fall or car accident):</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>​Do NOT use the Head-Tilt maneuver.</li>
<li><span>​Use the Jaw-Thrust maneuver:</span>Place your hands on both sides of the person's face and use your fingers to pull the lower jaw forward without moving the neck.</li>
</ul>
 <h2 class="header-title">​What to Avoid (Precautions) </h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><span>​❌ Do not put your fingers in the mouth:</span> You may accidentally push the tongue or an object further down, or the person may involuntarily bite you.</li>
<li><span>​❌ Do not use a pillow:</span>Placing a pillow under the head of an unconscious person can flex the neck and worsen the obstruction.</li>
<li><span>​❌ Do not leave them on their back</span>If a person is unconscious and breathing, leaving them flat on their back is dangerous.</li>
</ul>
 <h2 class="header-title">Prevention and Preparedness</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><span>Monitor Unconscious Patients:</span> Always stay with someone who is unconscious until medical help arrives.</li>
<li><span>​Learn CPR: </span>Proper training includes mastering airway management.</li>
<li><span>​Medical ID: </span>If you have a condition that causes frequent loss of consciousness (like epilepsy), wear a medical ID bracelet.</li>


</ul>
         <span>​⚠️ Note: If the "Head-Tilt, Chin-Lift" does not result in the person breathing, they may be in cardiac arrest. Start CPR immediately and call 911.</span>
