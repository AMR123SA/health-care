                ​<p class="main-subtitle">​Immediate Care and First Aid Steps</p>
                 <h2 class="header-text">Overview</h2>
                 ​<p class="subtitle-text">​Syncope is a sudden, brief loss of consciousness caused by a temporary drop in blood flow to the brain. While most fainting episodes are brief and not life-threatening, they can sometimes signal a serious underlying medical condition or lead to secondary injuries from falling.</p>
 <h2 class="header-text2">​When to Seek Emergency Care</h2>
  <p class="subtitle-text">​Call 911 (or your local emergency number) immediately if the person:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>​Does not regain consciousness within one minute.</li>
<li>​Is pregnant or has a known heart condition.</li>
<li>Experiences chest pain, palpitations, or shortness of breath.</li>
<li>​Suffered a head injury during the fall.</li>
<li>​Shows signs of a seizure (e.g., jerking movements, loss of bladder control, or tongue biting).</li>
<li>​Has difficulty speaking, blurred vision, or numbness in limbs (signs of a stroke).</li>
<li>​Fainted while exercising or after a sudden startle.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="header-title">​First Aid Treatment</h2>
<p class="subtitle-text">​If you see someone feeling faint or if they have already collapsed, follow these steps:</p>
<h3 class="secound-title">​1. Position the Person Safely</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>​If they haven't fallen yet, help them lie down on their back to prevent injury.</li>
<li>​If they are already on the ground, leave them there but ensure the area is safe.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="secound-title">​2. Improve Blood Flow (The Elevation Rule)</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li><span>​Lift the legs:</span>If there are no suspected injuries to the head, neck, or back, raise the person's feet about 12 inches (30 cm) above heart level. This helps blood return to the brain</li>
<li><span>​Loosen clothing: </span> Undo belts, collars, or any tight garments that might restrict breathing or circulation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="secound-title">​3. Check Airway and Breathing</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>​Ensure the person is breathing clearly.</li>
<li>​If the person does not wake up quickly, turn them onto their side (Recovery Position) to prevent them from choking if they vomit</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="secound-title">​4. Monitor Recovery</h3>
<ul class="list">
<li>​Once they wake up, keep them lying down for at least 10–15 minutes.</li>
<li>​Do not let them get up too quickly; have them sit up first for a few minutes before standing.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="header-title">​What to Avoid (Precautions) </h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><span>❌ Do not slap or shake them:</span>Physical force is unnecessary and can cause further injury.</li>
<li><span>​❌ Do not splash water on their face:</span>This can cause the person to inhale water into their lungs.</li>
<li><span>​❌ Do not put a pillow under their head:</span> This can curve the neck and potentially block the airway.</li>
<li><span>​❌ Do not give food or drink:</span> Wait until the person is fully alert and oriented before offering anything to swallow.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="header-title">​Prevention Tips</h2>
<ul class="list">
<li><span>​Recognize Warning Signs:</span>If you feel dizzy, nauseated, or get "tunnel vision," lie down immediately.</li>
<li><span>​Hydration: </span>Drink plenty of fluids, especially during hot weather or physical exertion.</li>
<li><span>​Avoid Sudden Transitions:</span> Move slowly when shifting from a lying position to a standing one (especially for the elderly).</li>
<li><span>​Medical Check-up:</span>If fainting episodes recur, consult a doctor to check blood pressure, heart rhythm, and glucose levels.</li>
</ul>
<span>​⚠️ Note: Even if the person feels "fine" after waking up, it is important to identify the trigger (e.g., dehydration, low blood sugar, or heat) to prevent it from happening again.</span>
